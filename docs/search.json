At this time in my life I am pretty sad but if I can make a personal blog and write journal entries about my life , it would help. I am going to do everything to learn coding so I can do just that !\nChao!"

    "text": "Tips for making a new post\n\nCopy the folder from your most recent post, then rename the folder relating to the specific post.\nAfter, open the folder and you should see a qmd file, open it and start typing\nRender\nThen Publish and Push to Git\n\nSecret tip: I got the words to be seperate by using a (-) key and putting a space between each line\nHow to install packages? To install packages use the install.packages (““) function , you want to make sure that the package you want to install is in quotation marks so that it completes properly. Secret tip: When you want to launch the packages you could use the library () function but it has to be completely installed. Otherwise use the ?:: function (written in your physical notebook )\nThere are different types of objects as well that may cause you (me lol ) to have problems in the future , so let me help you out.\nThere are three objects that I know of at this point in the course and they’re : names,age and date\n\nFor names , make sure to put the name in quotation marks\nFor objects such as age , do not put in quotation because it will read it as text rather than number\n\nI will type more tips in as I learn\nUntil we meet again !\n-For dates use the arrow and sys.date function. For example, for a holiday such as thanksgiving you can put thanksgiving–sys.date"
