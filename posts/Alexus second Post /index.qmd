**Tips for making a new post**

- Copy the folder from your most recent post, then rename the folder relating to the specific post.

- After, open the folder and you should see a qmd file, open it and start typing 

- Render 

- Then Publish and Push to Git 

**Secret tip: I got the words to be seperate by using a (-) key and putting a space between each line**

**How to install packages?**
To install packages use the install.packages ("") function , you want to make sure that the package you want to install is in quotation marks so that it completes properly. 
**Secret tip**: When you want to launch the packages you could use the library () function but it has to be completely installed. Otherwise use the ?:: function (written in your physical notebook )


There are different types of objects as well that may cause you (me lol ) to have problems in the future , so let me help you out. 

There are three objects that I know of at this point in the course and they're : names,age and date 

- For names , make sure to put the name in quotation marks 

- For objects such as age , do not put in quotation because it will read it as text rather than number 

I will type more tips in as I learn 


Until we meet again !

-For dates use the arrow and sys.date function. For example, for a holiday such as thanksgiving you can put thanksgiving--sys.date
